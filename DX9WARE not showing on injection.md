# Problem : DX9WARE does not appear after injection (2 Consoles)

First solution : 
Hold win + r
type %appdata%/dx9ware
click ok
Screenshot

Check if they have their DLLs, if not, look for anti viruses (as they delete the DLLs)
If the DLLs are still there, the injection may be delayed, apply the instructions in this page https://github.com/DX9david/DX9WARE-Troubleshooting/blob/main/DX9WARE%20injects%20after%20a%20few%20minutes.md



Second solution : Ask the user to open Control panel > Programs and features then screenshot everything in there, if you find rivatuner in their list of installed software, ask them to uninstall it before running DX9WARE

(Experimental) First solution :
**Reinstall Roblox**

Uninstall roblox lmfao thats it

(Experimental) Second solution : Close Riot Vanguard

# (1 Console)
Disable Windows Defender and uninstall any other anti viruses

Install vc_redist.x86.exe under the Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 section



(Experimental) solutions will not certainly work, but may work on some users
