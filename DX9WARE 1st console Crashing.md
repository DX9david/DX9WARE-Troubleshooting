# Problem : DX9WARE is crashing after logging in
First solution/step : Disable your antivirus (Ask the anti virus name, if it's Norton, MalwareByte or Mcafee you may ask the user to temporarily uninstall their AV)

Second solution :
- Uninstall Roblox
- Restart your computer
- Delete the dx9ware folder in %appdata% (WIN + R > type %appdata% and find the folder)
- Run the dx9injector as admin

DX9WARE CRASHING AFTER THE SECOND CONSOLE :

Intel 12th gen igpu can cause crashes
Turn it off in device manager

Potential solution : Open task manager > startup and disable all

Third solution : 
Step 1 Run Windows in safe mode (or just disable every single services with win+r > type ms config > click services > check the checkbox to hide ms services and disable all)

If dx9ware works in safe mode then it means a service is preventing access


Step 2 Open the msconfig, click services, check the checkbox and turn off anything that's extra ![imagee](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/962288062103162952/985206096379674684/unknown.png)
