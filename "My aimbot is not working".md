# Problem : The user's aimbot is not working

**Step one** : Ask the user if their ESP is working (with show team members on), if ESP works then aimbot works
**Step two** : Ask for a screenshot of their aimbot tab and search for the following
- Aimlock method (Set it to hotkey as Auto cdoesn't work on third person)
- Aim assist (Disable it)
- Silent Aim (Disable it.)
- Which aimlock key they are using (Show them that they need to hold that key)

**Step three** : Check if the enemies are on the same team, in that case enable Free For All on the aimbot


**Second scenario** : ESP does not work on the game, so does aimbot
Send them this lovely video which will help them to make a script on the game they want to use aimbot on (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6wBE2yrRoQ)
Note : the script doesn't work on FFA games because It includes your own character in the targets

**Third scenario** : Their entire DX9WARE broke, reinstall it (delete the dx9ware folder)
