# Problem : DX9WARE shows up on recording

Solution : 
- Close the recording software entirely (Check system trays for Medal)
- Open roblox and inject dx9ware
- Open the recording software
- Set to game capture or wait for Medal to detect Roblox

Second factor that disable DX9WARE's streamproof : "Reshade" or any cheats with a "Drawing API" will make streamproof not work -Yusuf
