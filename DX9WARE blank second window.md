# Problem : The second injection window shows yellow letters only

Potential solution : Roblox just updated and the user needs to wait for dx9

**First solution** : Ask them to make a brand new account and see if DX9WARE, if it works then send them this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i44o4P17y10&ab_channel=mechieboii

**Second solution** :
Search for "Run" in windows search or do windows button + r

Put this in the textbox: %appdata%\dx9ware and press ok

Find dx9ware.dll and delete it

Rerun DX9injector with admin permissions


**Third solution** : Use Roblox on another browser and inject
