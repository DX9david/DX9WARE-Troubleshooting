# Problem : DX9WARE injection is delayed
The 100% fix solution is to reinstall their Windows but I have gathered a special pack of bullshit solution that work sometimes!!!!

Solution 1 (Worked once) : 

Browse to %localappdata%
Delete the Roblox folder.

Browse to %appdata%\dx9ware
Delete dx9ware.dll

Solution 2 (Works more than you'd expect it to) :
Inject like 30 times lmfao (i am for real) (99% success rate?)

Solution 3 (Good one) : 
Change your DNS (good success rate)

Solution 4 :
Restart PC (At this point you're just waiting their time but sometimes it works lmfao)

Solution 5 (hot solution) : Inject multiple times, around 10 times and it might show up
