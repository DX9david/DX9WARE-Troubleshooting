# Problem : The second injection window shows yellow letters only

Potential solution : Roblox just updated and the user needs to wait for dx9

**First solution** : Reinstall Roblox, they may have ClientSettings or other modifications in their Roblox folder. To check, ask them to send a screenshot of their Roblox installation folder https://youtu.be/jUFNztmuQvs


**Second solution** :
Check if they have any other exploits like Synapse X or Script-Ware (executors) and disable Auto Attach and Auto Launch

**Old solution** :
Search for "Run" in windows search or do windows button + r

Put this in the textbox: %appdata%\dx9ware and press ok

Find dx9ware.dll and delete it

Rerun DX9injector with admin permissions


**Other old solution** : Use Roblox on another browser and inject
