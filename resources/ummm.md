If UUID won't open, tell them to Disable Windows Smart Screen

Crashing on the last console and can't get around it? If you have any of the 12th gen (alder lake) or 13th gen (raptor lake) intel processors, you'll have to disable the iGPU to use DX9WARE. To do this, go to device manager, select display adapters, locate and right click Intel UHD Graphics, select disable device.

Now go into a Roblox game, inject DX9WARE and see if it works - you might get an invalid whitelist error, in which case you follow https://cultofintellect.com/dx9ware/docs/DX9WARE/FAQ/CommonIssues/invalid-whitelist.html

It's currently unknown as to why this happens but for the good deal of you on modern hardware rocking the newest intel processors, this will solve your issue.

Unfortunately, this means that if you don't have a dedicated GPU to accompany your processor (12th-gen and 13th-gen CPU with e-cores), you may not be able to use DX9WARE because the iGPU would be your only graphics renderer.
